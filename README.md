#### Description
Simple Shell: This program was written entirely in C as a milestone project for ALX School.
#### Usage
After compilation, the resulting program can run stand-alone, either in interactive or non-interactive mode.

#### Interactive Mode
In interactive mode, simply run the program and wait for the prompt to appear. From there, you can type commands freely, exiting with either the "exit" command or ctrl-D.

#### Non-Interactive Mode
In non-interactive mode, echo your desired command and pipe it into the program like this:

echo "ls" | ./shell
In non-interactive mode, the program will exit after finishing your desired command(s).
